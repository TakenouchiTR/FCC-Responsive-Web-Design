                            Along with tweaking how the image will render, you can choose to render only a certain area of your map.

                            If a modded map is selected, Himeji Map Viewer will do its best to work around unknown blocks and biomes. 
                            You can select torender unknown blocks in Magenta, or to skip them and render the first known block 
                            below it. Biomes will be rendered using a default biome selected in the settings.
                        </p>
                        <p class="feature-desc">
                            After rendering, HMV will alert you if any unknown blocks or biomes were found. You may choose to import
                            these missing blocks and biomes so that you can assign colors to them. Biome names are not stored in the
                            file, so HMV will tell you where to go in your world to find the biome name.

                            Himeji Map Viewer supports all versions between Beta 1.3 and 1.16.1. HMV will be able to handle minor future
                            updates that do not change how the world files are saved by allowing you to manually enter new blocks and
                            biomes, reducing the need for constant updating as snapshots begin rolling out.
