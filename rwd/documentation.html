                        In order to use Himeji Map Viewer, you must have Java 8 or newer installed on your computer. Many users 
                        who have been playing Minecraft for a long time may have it installed already, but newer users
                        may not have had to download it in order to play. Since early 2015, Minecraft no longer required Java
                        to be installed in order to play.
                    </p>
                    <p>to check if your computer has the correct version of java installed, follow the following steps for your OS:</p>

                            If the output says "<code>java version "1.8.x"</code>" or higher, then you will be able to use HMV. However, 
                            if your output says "<code>java version "1.7.x"</code>" or lower, or if the command isn't recognized, 
                            please install the latest Java version.

                        The settings window is made up of four tabs: Rendering, Pop-ups, Preferences, and Memory. To get more 
                        information on a specific tab, please go to its section below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Changes made in the Settings window are not automatically saved. To save any changes, either press the 
                        "Save" or the "Apply" button at the bottom. "Apply" will save the changes, but keep the window open. "Save"
                        will save the changes and close the window.

                    <p>
                        Pressing the "Default" button will reset the values of the current tab to their default settings. The 
                        changes will not be saved until either the "Save" or "Apply" buttons are pressed. If the "Default" button
                        was pressed by mistake, you can close out of the window without saving to undo the change.

                        The Rendering tab contains four main settings for how the map will be rendered, along with options
                        for handling missing biomes and blocks.

                    <h2 class="spaced-section">Render at Night</h2>
                    <div class="section-body">
                        <p>
                            This option allows you to choose whether or not to take a block's brightness into account when rendering
                            the map. Turning it off will make every block draw at max brightness - including blocks that are 
                            underground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Night Brightness" slider allows you to set how dark to make blocks that aren't lit at all, with 0% 
                            being pitch black and 100% effective turning the option off.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section-body">
                        <p>
                            This option toggles whether certain blocks will be affected by the biome they are in. The block's base color 
                            is blended with the biome's color for the block's category. Blocks that are affected by biomes are broken into 
                            three categories: Grass, Foliage, and Water. For more information, view the "Block Flags" section below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Biome Intensity" slider allows you to adjust how much blocks are discolored by their biome. At 0%, there 
                            is effectively no change in color. At 100%, the block's color will be entirely changed to the biome color.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="spaced-section">Render Blocks Underwater</h2>
                    <div class="section-body">
                        <p>
                            This option toggles whether blocks that are located under water will be rendered or not. When turned off, 
                            water will appear completely opaque and hide whatever is underneathe it. When turned on, the color of the
                            block under the water block will be blended with the water's color.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Water Transparency" slider will affect how much the water's color will blend with the block underneathe
                            it. At 100%, the water will be entirely invisible, rendering as if there was no water at all. At 0%, the
                            water's color will completely overtake the block's color, effectively making the water opaque.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please not that the slider being at 0% does NOT make the water opaque. Blocks will still be affected by the
                            shading and highlighting option covered in the next section.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This option toggles whether blocks will either be shaded or highlighted based on their elevation
                            in relation to the blocks around them. Blocks that are higher will be highlighted, while blocks that
                            are lower will be shaded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Shadow Intensity" slider will affect how dark blocks will become when shading is applied. The lower
                            the value, the darker the shading will be. At 0%, there will be no shading applied. At 100%, the 
                            block will become pitch black.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Highlight Intensity" slider will affect how bright blocks will become when highlighting is applied. 
                            The higher the value, the brighter the highlighting will be. At 0%, the block will not be highlighted. At
                            100%, the block will approach completely white.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Lock shadow/highlight sliders" checkbox will lock the two sliders together. Moving one slider will
                            set the other slider to the same value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that blocks underwater will still have shading and highlighting applied to them
                            as long as the "Render Blocks Underwater" option is checked. This includes when the "Water Transparency"
                            slider is set to 0%.

                            default biome's color to applicable blocks. Missing blocks will be handled in one of two ways: Being
                            colored Magenta, or being completely ignored and having the first block underneathe drawn.

                    <h2 class="spaced-section">Default Folders</h2>

                        <p>
                            There are very similar options for selecting the default folder for selecting a world and choosing
                            an output file:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="spaced-section">
                            <li>Open straight to the last folder used.</li>
                            <li>Open the default Minecraft directory.</li>
                            <li>Select a specific folder to open everytime.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            When choosing the last option, a button and textbox will become enabled. Press the button to bring
                            up a folder selector. Navigate to your desired default folder, then press "Open" at the bottom to
                            select it.
                        </p>

                    <div class="section-body">
                        <p>
                            There are a handful of actions that can happen after a rander is completed:
                        </p>
                        <dl>
                            <li>Dont open images automatically after rendering</li>
                            <dd>No action will be taken; the program will only show a completion message at the bottom</dd>
                            <li>Ask to open images after rendering</li>
                            <dd>A dialog will appear and give the option to open the image.</dd>
                            <li>Always open images after rendering</li>
                            <dd>Images will automatically open after rendering has finished.</dd>
                            <li>Ask to open the image's folder after rendering</li>
                            <dd>A dialog will appear and give the option to open the folder containing the image.</dd>
                            <li>Always open the image's folder after rendering</li>
                            <dd>The folder the image is in will automatically open after rendering has finished.</dd>

                        <p>
                            This slider controls the maximum number of threads allowed to run at once. The higher the thread count, 
                            the faster the render, but will also use more system resources such as RAM and CPU time.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="spaced-section">Max Image Size</h2>
                    <div class="section-body">
                        <p>
                            This slider limits the size of the image to prevent overly large images from crashing the program. While
                            being rendered, the image is not being compressed - that is to say that the image in memory will not be
                            the same size as the output. Each pixel represents a block and is 4 bytes in size. One chunk equates to 
                            one kB, and one region file equates to one MB.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are not many cases where the image for a normal world will go above one GB. Keep in mind that
                            the map shows ungenerated chunks as black, which still takes up memory. By traveling long distances 
                            in the nether, the overworld may have many "islands" of generation that greatly increase the render size.

                        Blocks can be edited by opening the Color Editor window under Config>Block Colors. From this window, you can
                        select a block ID from the dropdown list. Selecting an ID will fill in the color fields on the left side of
                        the page. When the fields change, the preview panel on the right side of teh page will update to display the
                        color.

                        Colors can be edited by either entering a hex code into the "Hex" textbox, or by adjusting each of the three
                        RGB boxes individually. When you are pleased with the new color, press the "Accept" button to confirm the change.
                        Changes are ONLY saved for the session, unless the "Save" button is pressed. Pressing the "Save" button will
                        permanently save all changes to file.

                        Pressing the "Remove" button will remove a block ID from the list for the rest of the session. A dialog 
                        will appear asking for confirmation for the action, which can be disabled in the Settings window. If the 
                        "Save" button is pressed after an ID has been removed, the removal will be saved to file.
